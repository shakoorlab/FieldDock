# FieldDock
Code Repository for the FieldDock research project at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center. 

## Data Collection
FieldDock will be a fully automated field platform capable of comprehensive soil and environmental measurements, managing dailyautonomousUAVflightsthatwillcapturemultispectralandthermalmeasurementsofthefield.FieldDockwillthenanalyze
these measurements at the edge in a way that gives insight into a crop's performance in real world conditions at a high temporal resolutionwiththeaimofacceleratingthebreedingcycle.

## Remote GWAS & QTL Mapping 
FieldDock will process and analyze the imaging data in order to conduct aremote GWAS and QTL mapping against known genetic markers, crop models and pre-determined scores for crop performance.
