# FieldDock
Code Repository for the FieldDock research project at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center. 

## Data Collection
FieldDock will be a fully automated field platform capable of comprehensive soil and environmental measurements, managing daily autonomous UAV flights that will capture multispectral and thermal measurements of the field. FieldDock will then analyze
these measurements at the edge in a way that gives insight into a crop's performance in real world conditions at a high temporal resolution with the aim of accelerating the breeding cycle.

## Remote GWAS & QTL Mapping 
FieldDock will process and analyze the imaging data in order to conduct aremote GWAS and QTL mapping against known genetic markers, crop models and pre-determined scores for crop performance.
